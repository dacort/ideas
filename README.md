## Tenets

How I decide to move forward on these will rely on a set of tenets, influenced by Buster's [Book of Beliefs](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md).

- Don't reinvent the wheel - I often get stuck in trying to build somethign from scratch when I can just reuse existing components.
- One framework - What slows me down is ramping on new tech. Decide on one framework and use that as much as possible.
- Start small - Don't try to tackle the world at once. Do the bare minimum, see if it works, expand from tehre.
