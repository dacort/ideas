# Ideas

A repository of various ideas. #letsgetserious

The canonical list of ideas lives on this [project board](https://github.com/dacort/ideas/projects/1).

## Tenets

How I decide to move forward on these will rely on a set of tenets, influenced by Buster's [Book of Beliefs](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md).

- Don't reinvent the wheel - I often get stuck in trying to build somethign from scratch when I can just reuse existing components.
- One framework - What slows me down is ramping on new tech. Decide on one framework and use that as much as possible.
- Start small - Don't try to tackle the world at once. Do the bare minimum, see if it works, expand from tehre.

## Organization

I've created an issue for any idea I think I might want to build someday. And then for each issue, I consider the following:

- Audience: Who is this built for? Developers? Marketers? Just me?
- Effort: How long will it take to put this together? A couple weekends? A couple years?
- Reach: Am I building this just for myself or could this be a "really big" idea?
